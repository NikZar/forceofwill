      <b>What are cookies?</b>
      <br>
      When you visit a website for the first time it is likely that one or more cookies will be sent to your computer by that website. A cookie is a small text file that can be used to assign a unique reference number to your computer. That number only makes sense to – and is only readable by – the domain (usually a website) that served it. When you return to that website on another day from the same computer, the website can read your cookie and, in effect, recognise you.
      This simple technology gives websites a memory. It is possible to set your browser to block all cookies, but doing so will make some websites difficult or impossible to use.
